## abstract

The study focuses on the application of various clustering algorithms to analyze the Lok Sabha election results from the Election Commission of India. The primary objective is to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding voter behavior, demographic influences, and regional political dynamics. The dataset comprises detailed election results, including vote counts, winning margins, and party affiliations, across multiple election cycles.

We implemented several clustering algorithms, including K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering, to group constituencies based on voting patterns and demographic factors. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated using metrics such as silhouette scores, Davies-Bouldin index, and cluster coherence.
